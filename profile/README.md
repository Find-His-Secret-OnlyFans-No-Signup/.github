## Method 3: Check His Credit Card Statements

Money talks—and so do credit card statements. If your husband is on Ashley Madison, there’s a good chance you’ll find suspicious charges.

### What to Look For

- **Ashley Madison Charges**: Look for transactions labeled “Ashley Madison” or “AM.”
- **Unusual Payment Services**: Some users try to mask their activity by using payment processors instead of direct charges.
- **Prepaid Cards**: If your husband suddenly starts using prepaid Visa or Mastercard gift cards, he might be hiding something.

### What to Do If You Find a Charge

- **Stay Calm**: A charge doesn’t always mean he’s actively using the site.
- **Have an Honest Conversation**: Approach the topic with empathy and curiosity rather than accusation.

### Why This Method is Effective

Credit card statements don’t lie. If your husband is spending money on Ashley Madison, it will show up here. Just make sure you’re prepared for what you might find.
